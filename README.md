#DESCRIPTION

Real-Time Chat Application – A Seamless Messaging Experience
In today's fast-paced digital world, communication plays a crucial role in staying connected. Our Real-Time Chat Application is a fully responsive, frontend-only chat app built using React.js. This project is designed specifically for beginners who want to create a functional chat system without dealing with backend complexities or WebSockets. By leveraging the BroadcastChannel API, this app enables seamless communication across multiple tabs within the same browser.

🚀 Key Features
✅ Instant Messaging: Users can send and receive messages in real time.
✅ Local Storage Integration: Messages are saved in the browser, ensuring they remain available even after a page refresh.
✅ Multiple Tabs Communication: Using BroadcastChannel API, messages sync across all open tabs of the same browser.
✅ User-Friendly UI: A clean, modern, and responsive chat interface that adapts to different screen sizes.
✅ Emoji & Formatting Support : Users can enhance their messages with emojis and text formatting.

💡 How It Works?
1️⃣ User opens the chat app.
2️⃣ Enters a message in the input box and hits send.
3️⃣ The message is displayed instantly in the chat window and stored in LocalStorage for persistence.
4️⃣ If another tab of the same browser is open, the message appears there in real time using the BroadcastChannel API.
5️⃣ Users can continue chatting seamlessly across multiple tabs.
